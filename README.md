# real-estate-database

This project was built for a Database Management Systems Class.

This SQL Server database is designed to help a potential buyer track residential properties of interest, track appointments and store other useful information (such as listing agent contact details, information on the different localities and their respective tax rates). 

A GUI for the database was built in Java, using NetBeans.
