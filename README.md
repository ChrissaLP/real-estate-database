# real-estate-database

This project was built for a Database Management Systems Class.

This SQLServer database is designed to help a potential buyer track residential properties of interest,
track appointments and store other useful information (such as listing agent contact details,
information on the different localities and their respective tax rates).

A GUI for the database was built in Java, using NetBeans, see the code in the **Java** folder.

See the **docs** folder for more information about the tables and available stored procedures used to insert, update, and
delete information from the different tables. An E-R Diagram is also included the **Docs** folder.

The **scripts** folder includes individual files to:
* create the tables (using sample data drawn from public sources)
* create stored procedures
* drop the tables and the stored procedures
